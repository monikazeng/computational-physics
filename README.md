# computational-physics
A collection of computational physics projects applying methods from Numerical Recipes, focusing on algorithmic implementation and interpretation of numerical results.

## Project 1
- **Problem 1:** Approximate \(\sin(x)\) using a truncated Taylor series expansion. The function takes inputs \(x\) and truncation order \(N\), returning the series approximation. Truncation errors are analyzed by comparing approximations across different values of \(x\) and \(N\).
- **Problem 2:** Derive a symmetric finite difference formula for numerical differentiation using Heaviside calculus. The coefficients and leading error term are determined to understand the approximationâ€™s accuracy.

## Tools
- MATLAB for coding, plotting, and generating HTML reports.
